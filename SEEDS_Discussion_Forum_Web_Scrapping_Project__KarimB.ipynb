I know I didn't hallucinate it because it was so loud that she heard it over the phone and asked me what it was. It lasted like 1-2 seconds before it faded away.

When he busted all over my face (it was a fat load, I don't think he came for a while), a bit of his milky swimmers got caught in my eye. While I was wiping it away, I saw what looked like a tall, vaguely humanoid figure clad in all white, standing and staring at me sucking this dude's cum off my fingers as desperately as a victorian child eating moldy bread. I thought it was just more of his succulent semen swimming in my eyes, but there was none left. I was very scared and accidentally bit on his tip (Sorry Dave!)\n",

Females see me as an object and a genius, when really I'm so much more: I'm top 100 in the world in World of Warships. My black shirt shouldn't reduce me to a bag of meat; if you want my heart, you have to grind with me, raid with me, join my clan, and most of all, watch Rick and Morty with me, and understand it -- no fake fans that shout \"pickle rick\" like its some kind of joke, when it's really the climax of the most tragic episode of season 3.

In spite of itemizing over 100+ methods of what she articulates & how one reciprocates, **in reality, the utterances she utters surpasses the centenary mark, thus the scope I encompass with my cheat sheet is nearing 0%, and more often than not, you must instigate the dialogue, refraining from waiting for them to commence the discourse initially.** Analogous to the realm of CS40, even if you are unquestionably familiar with the properties of a bipartite graph or comprehend the functioning of error-correcting codes, you may still find yourself unable to resolve specific problem instances. These situations often demand flexible mathematical reasoning, akin to tackling complex graph theory problems, and this requirement underscores the importance of mathematical induction, a general skill.\n",

I was contemplating adding Mus 15, EarthW 20 (to finish a section of my science requirements), or any other GE that doesn’t require as much work if spots open up, and I’m fine with essays if that is the workload. Also, for EarthW 20 w/ Jackson, I noticed the dates and times are TBA, but it is remote instruction, async; does that mean there won’t be any lectures for the class, only sections, or will it switch periodically? Any suggestions or advice would be helpful.\n",
