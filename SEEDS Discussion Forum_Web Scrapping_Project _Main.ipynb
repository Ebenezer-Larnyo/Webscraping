      "Hey there people of Reddit. Iâm a 23 year old male and as of lately Iâve realized some stuff thanks to a few friends and this guy I was dating for a while. So what happened is that while I was hanging out with a friend he noticed a lot of things in my behavior that are signs of autism. The guy is studying to become a psychiatrist and what he pointed out is my lack of eye contact while speaking, stimming by tapping my foot or even tapping the table we were sitting at this also increases some vocal stimming, and one thing he definitely noticed was me glowing when we talked about a special interest I have. I do usually struggle to understand social cues and tend to do things on impulse and that dose usually land me in trouble. And another thing is that when a situation dose get to overwhelming for me I do go nonverbal till I calm myself down. Even if I am autistic I donât know who to talk to or where I can see someone to get an official diagnosis. To whoever is reading this and knows who I can talk to please let me know and thank you.\n",

Life hasn't been fun the last few years and my ability to tolerate stress, pressure, socializing difficulties, sensory sensitives has declined and now i'm a bit of a mess.

I have to mask all the time even with my family because people hate when I'm unmasked but I barely have the energy to do so. I have to conserve my energy and choose between certain things but people always tell me it shouldn't be hard to do both. I'm constantly compared to how I used to be: happy, socializing, productive. Even when I tell people that I was constantly anxious as a kid and teenager to be that way, and I rarely ever kept a friend longer than a year, they only see masked me.

      " I donât like letting autisim define me. I donât like using it as an excuse. But itâs so hard to not sound like I am. I hang in a room at break time at school where Iâm the only autistic one. And Iâm just so fucking tired of always being perceived as aggressive, judging and mean. I really hate making my friends upset cuz I like them all and they like me and they always get so confused when I randomly start yelling or why Iâm just sitting there quiet. And I do refer to my autisim diagnosis and adhd diagnosis as a reason. I can tell they are sick of me âpulling the autisim card.â and they are entitled to that opinion. Im sick of âpulling the autism card.â At this point, thereâs no use even giving a reason. They know the reason. Im now just the crazy autistic girl. And they shouldnât have to deal with me. Theyâre teenagers not psychologists. And what the fuck am I meant to do.  Give them a detailed list of the side effects of my medications, dos and donts. Educate them on all things autisim? Fuck that. Even my best friend is getting tired of me and I donât blame her.  I feel horrible about it. And she doesnât even ask me why when i do something. We know its autisim and thatâs hardly good enough anymore. The frustrating thing is that it is literally why Iâm like this. I am so fucking sick of being autistic. I hate it so much. I just wish I could show them the side of me that makes them want to be my friend. Except they have to be around this dead faced. Cynical and rude bitch. cuz I love my friends and I just wish I wasnât so negative, and irritable and completely unaware of how im coming across. Before anyone says I need more understanding friends I do have very understanding friends but Iâm their friend not their child. Thereâs only a certain level of understanding you can expect from people before you have to start respecting their boundaries and patience levels. I canât live like this anymore. I want to change so bad. Iâm so sick of having to apologise for my behaviour especially since 90% of the time, I dont really understand why Iâm apologising or what Iâm necessarily apologising for. Im sick of always realising the true extent of my actions after hours, days. Weeks, months and even years and that itâs too late to apologise. Its so hard having to see my mother, my family, my friends or literally Anyone give me that look. We all know that look, the look normal people give us that absolutely breaks my heart. I dream of life without this thing. To those who have read this far.  Pls any help. Any suggestions, tips, advice on how to..how to not be so fucking autistic. And donât pull that itâs a superpower bullshit with me. I want to know how to manage it. \n",

I kind of expected to be prescribed an SSRI, but he prescribed me risperidone/ Risperdal (0,5mg). As some of you might know a very light dose of antipsychotics can help with overstimulation and meltdowns in autistic people.

Negative: when I get upset or stressed about something, I can get mentally stuck on it for anywhere from hours to days. Big or small- canât stop thinking about the chores until I do them. Bills that are due. Money I do or donât have in the bank. My wife gets very frustrated when I get fixated because Iâll run in mental loops and repeat myself.

      "Autism isn't always impairing: a look at the DSM (long)\n",
      " I know a lot of us like using the DSM to define autism -- the diagnostic  criteria says autistic people are impaired, therefore, if you are  autistic you are impaired. But I just got ahold of the DSM ASD section  and there's more to it than that -- about 7,000 words' worth of \"more\". I  want to show how the DSM is consistent with the idea that autistic  people are not necessarily disabled. (However, if you tell me ASD is not  a disability I will find you in the comments and steal your toes.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Disclaimer: I'm not a diagnostician, I'm just a layperson conveying my best understanding!\n",
      "\n",
      "Level 1 autism is described as autism that can be well-compensated-for with  supports. \"Without supports in place, deficits in social communication cause noticeable impairments\" is how the DSM's diagnostic criteria puts  this.\n",
      "\n",
      "People can wobble in and out of this definition over their  lifetime. They may not meet all parts the diagnostic criteria at the  same time. This is what the DSM has to say on that (square brackets  mine): \"The severity specifiers \\[levels\\] may be used to describe  succinctly the **current symptomatology (which might fall below level 1**),  with the recognition that **severity may vary by context and fluctuate  over time**. Severity of social communication difficulties and restricted,  repetitive behaviors should be separately rated.\" To me, this means one  can get a diagnosis even when they currently do not meet part of the  criteria -- and people may stop meeting criteria after diagnosis. It also says \"Diagnostic criteria may be met when restricted,  repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities were clearly  present during childhood or at some time in the past, **even if symptoms  are no longer present**.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are not currently struggling in  some way with autism, you are unlikely to get a diagnosis of ASD.  However, you **may qualify for one in the future or have met criteria in the past**: \"Because  symptoms change with development and may be masked by compensatory  mechanisms, the diagnostic criteria may be met based on historical  information, although the current presentation must cause significant  impairment.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Who does and does not have ASD is acknowledged to be  a little fuzzy in the DSM. \"the symptoms of autism spectrum disorder  occur as dimensions **without universally accepted cutoff scores** for what  would constitute a disorder.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So, after all that, why am I going  to steal your toes if you tell me ASD isn't a disability? Because  \"disability\" and diagnosis is often the way society determines whether  it's going to support vulnerable people. The DSM itself believes this is  a problem: \"The descriptive severity categories should not be used to  determine eligibility for and provision of services.\" We should look to advocate for all autistic people -- and the word disability helps there.\n",
      "\n",
      "But  you? You don't need to be disabled to have ASD or autism. You may not  even qualify for diagnosis! Diagnosis or not, you may be what I'd call sub-clinical, or level 0.\n",

I was forced to go to SE for like 2 weeks in high school. I lied to them and told them I didnât need the help. I convinced them to let me be a TA instead.

To give context, I was recently diagnosed autistic and right now this is a learning experience for me. In the past two years I've been having meltdowns and shutdowns quite a lot. I still have them but right now I'm in the early stages of getting resources for me. So right now it's been hard to explain to my parents on what I'm going thorough. My mom completely shut it down and disregards my feeling, my dad kinda understand but still have expectations on me (in a more neurotypical view.) So of my current life I'm more lonely and just feel more alien in the family. I don't really have a social support, hence why I'm ranting here. so today is my nephew's birthday and I honestly just feel more selfish. I could only think about how my birthday went (I cried on my birthday and didn't do anything and was also forgotten. Tried to make it up with my parents but they  were busy so I didn't bother it with.) And I guess it still hurts me. Just seeing my nephew getting a special day where people care about him just hurts me. I love my nephew with all my heart but everything just overwhelmed me. I don't know why but I was in my room resting and the family came. I heard mom getting my aunt and for some reason I thought waiting if she was going to get me. But I was forgotten, took them about 10 min to notice. So already the feeling of hurt is lingering but also it was very crowed and I couldn't sit with my parents (to feel safe and comfort in crowded places.) but all the seats was taken. So I went to the kitchen and I was just sitting there. I felt aliened and invisible. And all I wanna do is go back. My nephew wanted me to join the group but I couldn't. I was overwhelmed with everything. I went to my and never came out. But I was so upset with myself that I couldn't push it through. I know what I did was selfish but I couldn't. I just really hate myself right now and I wish I never existed. My existence is a waste of space and I'm burdening everyone right now. Why I'm like this? I did came out after the party to pee and get dinner (couldn't wait any longer) and my parents were there, but didn't really check on me. I know they ae busy tho, my dad have surgery tomorrow and I'm still being selfish. If I can I'll talk to my therapist about it and all. Is there anyway to cope all this?

Whilst I am happy that heâs learning new things and interacting more, I have noticed a serious acceleration in meltdowns, hitting, smacking and biting himself and others, disruptive episodes, like deliberately breaking objects, etc. He is also a lot more hyperactive than usual, like a bottle of pop. Just constantly up to something, for example, trying to empty an entire kitchen cupboard, then when I intervene, he runs away and laughs (he thinks weâre playing), and whilst Iâm busy trying to clean that mess, heâs onto something else, like turning on all the bathroom taps and then going into his sister's room and throwing all her stuff onto the floor.\n",

However, I see so many people becoming easily emotional, even others on the spectrum or who are neurodivergent. Iâve never gotten it. Iâm not insensitive, you just wonât catch me crying or getting really upset, even if I feel just as sad as you. Iâm an empathetic person so if you feel something it will rub off on me. Like, for example my band director is leaving. Yesterday we had our last performance in the stadium and my mom was crying the whole time because she could sense that the kids were sad that she was leaving and it made her sad. Iâve never got that.  The problem is that since I donât show my emotions or really express them if theyâre negative, they pile up for months and then once every few months, I tend to have a meltdown, usually over something petty.

I didn't so much as know what a meltdown even was, and I had no IEP since I wasn't diagnosed. Yet it still happened without a fail. I had no idea at the time why they'd do this for me. It was as if they knew something about me that I didn't. What was even weirder was that if other students got upset, they weren't usually removed from class. It just felt like I was the only one. In a weird way, it felt like special treatment, while also being isolated from my peers. Not to mention that I was usually the only person in the class who was allowed to do group projects on my own, and whenever a seating chart was rearranged I was usually the only person to keep my seat. It felt really strange at the time, but I didn't complain since I really didn't mind all that much. Looking back on it, I'm pretty sure the teachers suspected especially given that a few of my friends (who were a couple of grades below me) received similar treatment and were later diagnosed as autistic. It really felt bizarre to each of us until one after another we were each diagnosed. It became a sort of joke in our group that we'd chant \"One of us, one of us!\" when another person in the group was diagnosed. Did anyone else have a similar experience growing up?\n",

      "**1. Glutamate and Alzheimer's Disease: A Dysregulated Balance**\n",
      "\n",
      "In Alzheimer's disease, a condition marked by progressive memory loss and cognitive decline, alterations in glutamatergic neurotransmission appear central (Wang and Reddy, 2017). Glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in our brain, has shown both protective and destructive roles in the context of Alzheimerâs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Protective Role: At synapses, the signaling of NMDAR (a type of glutamate receptor) is vital for neuron survival. This synaptic NMDAR-mediated signaling is protective against degenerative processes (J Alzheimers Dis, 2017).\n",
      "\n",
      "Destructive Role: Outside synapses, when glutamate interacts with extrasynaptic NMDARs, it triggers harmful pathways leading to neurodegeneration (J Alzheimers Dis, 2017). This action counters the positive effects of synaptic signaling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent therapeutic efforts, like memantine, target this extrasynaptic NMDAR signaling and have shown potential in Alzheimerâs treatment (J Alzheimers Dis, 2017). Moreover, temporal changes in hippocampal glutamate levels could indicate a transition from healthy aging to Alzheimer's (Cox et al., 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Glutamate and Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Genetic-Metabolic Nexus**\n",
      "\n",
      "Autism Spectrum Disorder, a multifaceted neurodevelopmental disorder, exhibits symptoms from social challenges to repetitive behaviors. The role of glutamate in ASD encompasses both genetic and metabolic perspectives:\n",
      "\n",
      "Genetic Factors: Gene variants, especially NLGN, NRXN, and SHANK, influence glutamatergic dysregulation in ASD. Defects in these genes can modify excitatory brain activity (Lim et al., 2022).\n",
      "\n",
      "Metabolic Factors: Folate's interaction with glutamate can amplify its excitatory properties. Dysregulated folate and glutamate homeostasis are believed to play a pivotal role in ASD (Tisato et al., 2021). The interplay between folate metabolism and glutamatergic signaling further solidifies the metabolic link to ASD (Tisato et al., 2021).\n",
      "\n",
      "These genetic and metabolic pathways highlight the intertwined etiology of ASD, where glutamatergic dysregulation emerges as a crucial intersection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "In both Alzheimerâs disease and Autism Spectrum Disorder, glutamate stands out as a significant player. Its relationship with each condition, although varying, emphasizes its dysregulation, offering hope for therapeutic interventions (Wang and Reddy, 2017; Tisato et al., 2021). As research continues, deciphering glutamate's interactions in these disorders will be fundamental for innovative treatments and improved patient outcomes.\n",

      "My mother resents me & my autism.\n",
      "I'm feeling like human garbage right now. To add context: I'm 23 y/o. I go to school but am not able to hold down a job. Because of this I still live with my mother and rely on her financially. Our relationship has never been the best but she helps me a great deal. I've been really burnt-out and it's getting worse due to school so she helps me when I cant properly take care of myself due to being overwhelmed 24/7. So yeah, she does a lot for me and I'm forever grateful to her for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, 6 months ago I got my official ASS diagnosis and the constant exhaustion and struggles finally started to make sense. My mother understand why the diagnosis was given to me, yet she doesn't like it when I bring it up. Yesterday I asked her if I could close the blinds as I explained my autism and the sensory overload I was experiencing in that moment made the light from outside unbearable for me. She exploded in anger yelling how I am always bringing up autism and ''victimizing'' myself ever since I got my diagnosis. She went on a rant yelling about how she is done making adjustments in her life / our home to accommodate me. She told me I have stolen her life from her, made her miserable and should be more grateful for all the sacrifices she has made for me. She says she's tired of looking after me all the time and wishes I could just ''get better in dealing with my autism'' already - because many adults with autism can function just fine; so why can't I? She accuses me of being manipulative and taking advantage of my newfound diagnosis as, according to her, my autism symptoms have become ''worse'' ever since I've gotten my diagnosis. When all I've been doing is trying to mask less at home and have stopped pushing myself as much so I don't get meltdowns as often.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know what to do. I feel so guilty for relying on her so much. I knew it must be a lot for her to handle but I never realized she actually resented me this much for it. She always told me she didn't mind helping me out so much as she does it out of love, but it has now become obvious that is all a lie. I feel like such a failed human being. I don't want to be a bother to her. If I could I would love to move out but it's impossible for me to hold a job - I'm already struggling to finish school as is. I feel so trapped. Can anyone relate? How can I ever become a selfsufficient adult and move out when I can't hold a job?\n",

Right now I don't have any of the foods i want in my house, and I can't eat anything because i feel sick even if i take a single bite. I wonder if that has something to do with my sensory issues or is my organism just weird?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Â¿How would you react\n",
      "What If I told you that I found a cure to the plights of autistic people all over the world. And it's very simple and logical? And it would get rid of most of your problems? Though it wouldn't cure ADHD, GAD etc. symptoms and it wouldn't get rid off sensory problems and stims and meltdowns(though it would help you prevent burnouts). Would you believe that such method could exist, that it would allow you to live in better word, that it could get rid off your insecurities, could it do that, is that achievable? What do you think about it?\n",

      "\n",
      "For a while now I've been denying the possibility that I qualify for ASD simply because my exposure to what neurotypicals consider \"autistic\" is kids with learning disabilities who have a tendency to be violent and are just \"detached\" from the tacit norms of life. \n",
      "\n",
      "Over the past year, however, my surroundings have exposed me to neurodivergency(?) much more than the remaining years of my life, in the sense that I now recognise it as a spectrum â aka not a \"one size fits all\" diagnosis. It's often that I now hear that I've got traits that one would consider neurodivergent, yet I've never really put much thought into it (not enough to seek professional help) until now.\n",
      "\n",
      "In one of my seminars recently, we were handed out an extract to annotate and analyse regarding the topic we had discussed earlier in the lecture; I received the overall extract quite well, including tiny details here and there. My peers, however, did not. The character was deemed \"arrogant\", \"hypocritical\" and \"critical towards spending money (for charity, events, etc).\" I did not see the character the same way. I, in fact, agreed with everything the character said and did besides the alcoholism (I don't drink).\n",
      "\n",
      "It made me feelâ¦ estranged. Far more than usual. So much so that I could not focus on the discussion at all anymoreâ¦ Part of me thought that perhaps my response to it differed due to cultural upbringing, but my gut feeling said it was more than that. So I took it up with the professor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The professor was lovely, understanding of all I brought up, and thanks to them, I was encouraged to book an appointment with the doctor to get an official statement regarding thisâ¦ My mother always denied me having autism (based on the \"learning disability\" misconception), but I still want to be sureâ¦\n",
      "\n",
      "The past few days, I've been doing research. I am in no way, shape or form self-diagnosing, but I was unaware that I qualified for mild/high-functioning autism so much. I took it up with an acquaintance whom I could confide in and request help/guidance (something I've never done). Everything that came to mind in the 30+ mins I spoke for wereâ¦ a lot to take in, in their words.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, that's a lot of context, yet probably not enoughâ¦ The point is, I have booked an appointment and it should be in two weeks' time. I'm getting anxious about it because it'll be over the phone when I'd initially started to (in my head) plan for an in-person appointment where I could bring that aforementioned extract to show how it made me feelâ¦\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm justâ¦ confused? Anxious? Scared? It feels likeâ¦ a big step in my life. The best way I can describe it is that this â that qualifying in the spectrum (officially) â is \"the answer\". It might explain my entire essence, something that I myself am still trying to understand; why can I understand others but others can't understand me, as the bigger questionâ¦\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm thinking of writing a list to refer to during the appointment, but I don't know what to expectâ¦ I was advised to just \"be myself\", but I don't know how to do that without letting the \"I'm completely fine\" faÃ§ade fadeâ¦ Are there any questions/statements I should prepare myself forâ¦?\n",

This guy begins his ted talk and I guess he noticed I wasn't looking at him and he wouldn't leave me alone, he kept asking if I was paying attention and why I wasn't doing as he instructed (which I did do btw), and eventually he started asking me to smile, to show that I was paying attention.\n",

      "I know, he's a fucking asshole and I don't owe anybody a smile, but I was way too overloaded to think about anything, so I just tried my hardest to give my tiniest, fakest smile, just so he'd leave me alone already, but I couldn't smile. I just couldn't. At all. I genuinely tried my hardest to just squeeze my muscles the \"right\" way and couldn't.

      "The worst part? I have told them countless times to not put their hands near my face when I have a meltdown cause I have the impulse to bite, yet they still do that and they get bitten cause I'm 100% unable to control myself during meltdowns! And then we all cry and it's terrible for the rest of the night and I know I can't control it but I also feel at fault.\n",
      "I wish I wasn't autistic every day, even If meltdowns are rare they're not so rare that I don't have to worry about them, expecially cause I don't always feel them coming so I sometimes can't do anything about It at all.\n",

      "- Not being able to drink from a water bottle if I started it a little while ago\n",
      "- Similar to above but with open drinks in the fridge \n",
      "- Not being to sit on sofaw or armchairs at rentals or Airbnb if they don't look brand new or are made of porous material (so leather sofa are usually ok, fabric or velvet sofas are usually not)\n",

      "- Immediately disgusted and very bothered if there's any stain on cutlery at a restaurant \n",
      "- Fear of breathing bad smells outside if unidentified or from known unsanitary origins (vs. normal bad smell being very unpleasant physically but not as stressful mentally)\n",

She can't read or write, and if I ask her to say something she'll just go \"yayy!\" She HAS started saying a lot more things as she's become more comfortable at our program, but it's still a small amount, and she often talks gibberish. She does use some sign language. Speech therapy isn't an option, so I'm trying to find some speech activities that aren't for toddlers with a delay or tweens with a speech impediment. I'm also working on a PECS board for her to use, she's good about pointing at things to communicate what she wants when that's an option, but if I she is typically unable to respond to verbal questions, even yes or no questions, so getting her input is difficult and I fo want her to have more freedom to choose things.

I played with and spoke to my stuffed toys until I was in middle school and that was when my parents took them away because they said I was too old for it and it was making me \"soft\". I had a stuffed anatomical stomach, he was my favorite. I found him years later when I was helping my family clean the house, but my stepdad destroyed him and made me clean up the mess.\n",
      "\n",
      " My speech has gotten better over the years but itâs still not consistent, I still have trouble with speech speed, stuttering, and pronunciation and enunciation. Also it feels like I have an auditory delay. Someone will say something, but itâs as if thereâs a delay in the processing as it wonât click. Sometimes I donât immediately understand and it may take a few moments for it to register. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also had very few friends growing up and at often times I'd be a loner like I am right now. My family always said that I was an odd child, but only in recent years did they suspect that I was on the spectrum. To this day, Iâve never been officially diagnosed. My folks would sometimes joke about how they should've gotten me diagnosed so they could get a check from the gov't for me.\n",

      "The school itself wasn't that bad and the teachers were nice enough. As time went on, I developed to a point where I was above most of the students, and it was obvious at 14 I should go to a different school since the barebone education wasn't doing it and I wanted to socialize with normal kids. I was promised I would go to a different school... and then at 15 my parents started divorcing...\n",

      "At 17, I walked out of that school with a grade 4-ish education, no friends and no idea how to make any. My mom wanted me to stay in there until I was 18 so I can have the school name on my job applications, like that fucking matters at all, and the only reason why I got out early is because my dad knew I didn't belong there.\n",

A year after that I finished the grade with amazing results but the tutors applied for teaching at a school and would not have time for me, due to my dad's pay being inconsistent.

He claims to âtreatâ a lot of autistic persons, and by some of us around here, heâs seen as a quasi-mythical figure. See you, in the country I live, psychoanalysis is strong, probably the strongest and most well known method to deal with psychological questions.\n",

He presents as sort of \"NT' at school and at home (I don't think he is code switching, or not that I've observed). And enjoys his friendships and seeks them out. Where I see the ASD piece play out is a little bit the lack of that 'click' and true deep connection, that I had as a kid with my bffs. It also plays out in the fact that he can be inflexible and a bit of a black and white thinker (we have spent a lot of time working through the concept of fairness). He has amazing perspective taking skills and is thoughtful. He bites/ picks his nails a lot and I suspect some low level anxiety (I am very anxious also). He gets easily frustrated and can be a little pointed. He is doing ok right now, but I because he's an 'atypical presentation', I don't always know how to best support him and would love POVs from folks here. Is he masking? How can I support deeper friendships?

      "I am a 29 year old woman, who has had a difficult life and I am still struggling and have been seeking answers as to why. I was diagnosed with ADHD a year ago and have since been actively working with it rather against it with great results. However, I am hoping to reach individuals who have had experienced something similar to my experience getting a diagnosis for autism. I recently did an assessment and she said there are âno signs of autism.â My first question is, when you got your diagnosis did you see a professional who SPECIALIZES in this particular area or did you seek a generalized neuropsychologist who did a general assessment. I feel weird questioning her especially not being a health professional myself, but I cannot shake this feeling that she is wrong. I know in my gut that there is more to this and I am aware they have many similar symptoms and can often go misdiagnosed, etc. I am planning on getting a second opinion hopefully from a professional who specializes in that area to get some peace of mind. I am not diagnosis seeking, I am seeking answers and reassurance that I am not crazy. Again not a doctor and not self diagnosing but hopefully explaining a few things may relate to someone here that will make me feel less alone. Some of these things include: rubbing my fingernail ends back and forth until theyâre smooth, rocking back and forth to self soothe, tuning out the world with headphones sometimes is the only way I can detach myself, having what I consider a meltdown from sensory issues such as wet socks, the wrong clothing material, being misunderstood, being too hot or cold, I would rather watch kids shows, collect âtoys,â I cannot make eye contact when speaking unless they are a safe person, food textures are a huge issues, sensitivity to light and sound, preparing my speech before it happens and picking myself after afterwards, walking around with T. rex arms, HATING small talk, making friend is non existent and maintaining friendships is even harder, I have one person I can be myself with and âunmask,â I literally made up my own language that my immediate family has picked up on and I speak in âa baby talkâ sometimes, I prefer to be alone in my own space, I am aware I want to talk about what I want to talk about without giving much care to others even though I donât mean to, history of self harming, I have to force myself to make eye contact speaking to a new person and itâs painful, intimacy is hard for me, I take things very literal and sometimes it messes situations up for me, having passion for things but limited if that makes sense, I used to twirl my hair so bad to self soothe that I put it in knots and I had to cut them out. Again, I know a lot of these traits overlap with ADHD but if anything resonates with you and someone could help me understand if it is just ADHD or if it does sound like a second opinion would not be crazy to seek please let me know. If you made it this far thank you for reading.\n",

      "Voice volume control and perception\n",
      "So basically I just had a fight with my partner because I was speaking to him and suddenly he yelled at me to âstop shoutingâ. This is something we actually have discussed in the past and I have explained to him that itâs difficult for me to perceive how the volume of my voice changes throughout a conversation and I would like him to tell me if I get too loud because I know I do that and it bothers him a lot. He has told me sometimes like âcan you lower your volumeâ and things like that which I accept but he really doesnât understand that I really donât understand that my voice has gotten to a loud volume. It bothers him so much that most of the time like today he will yell at me and say he is yelling at me because I started yelling and say that the room is echoing from how loud Iâm speaking and I should be able to know that Iâm being really loud. I honestly donât know how to make him understand that I donât do it on purpose and when I explained that it most likely stems from the fact I have autism he says that itâs children with autism that have issues with this and as an adult I should know by now! I am really distraught and I just want to know if I really am stupid and should know how to regulate my voice volume at this point. I usually get loud when I talk about things I like or when Iâm really engrossed in a conversation but this time and a lot of other times it would just be a normal conversation with my partner and I will get loud like this. He has sensory issues as well and gets irritated really easily by loud noises so I understand that itâs really uncomfortable for him and I want to get better but itâs really hard! Please anyone that has been in similar situations could you give any advice as to how to proceed with making the other person understand? And also any advice on helping me getting better at controlling my volume would be really appreciated!\n",

      "I have this thing where I donât like walking on cracks on the ground/floor because it makes me feel uncomfortable. Because if I step on a crack with one foot it feels like it weighs more than the other, and I have to step on the crack with my other foot as well to make it balanced. Itâs like there is an invisible weight being added to the side of my body where I stepped on the crack. So therefore I just avoid walking on them which can be pretty hard sometimes if for example the ground/floor is tiled. My question is; is this an autistic ting? Iâve heard that autistic people have sensory issues and Iâm wondering if this is a thing?

But itâs not like I can never eat brown food because I can. Itâs just that I couldnât do that in that moment.

And the meltdowns were big, loud and violent- and only ever in private. When I so much as slammed my pen down angrily at my desk, Iâd have my manager in my ear for disrupting other people nearby. So I retreated to the toilets and let loose. Fists and heads would impact walls and doors, Iâd scream myself hoarse and regularly break down crying. And then go back and endure the rest of my shift. I would, of course, also regularly self-harm at my desk- the middle finger on my left hand is now in constant pain from the number of times Iâve bent and twisted it out of shape, and I have noticeable scars on my wrists from where Iâd scratch myself until I bled (which was also criticised for disrupting other people nearby). And this is all because a bunch of twats in suits in the capital- every capital, I suppose- decided that in order for me to be able to eat, I have to subject myself to this borderline torture on a daily basis.\n",

      "I'll go first. Read carefully. I never feel good enough. Not to other people but to myself. Theres standarts i put in my head that i want to achieve for myself and i'm incredibly perfectionistic. Why is because i often think if i don't reach a certain level in my life i'll only be limited even more thanks to my autism. To me, my autism is a curse and it has always been the cause of everything bad in my life and it has always been in the way. My social skills are still bad. I can't keep friends. My planning and organising is even worse. And i always get easily overwhelmed or stressed about the simplest parts in my education because of fear of failure. I think i will drop out of my college this next year. Why is because again, because of my autism, i can't take on one simple ducking task. Thing is i know i am very bright and it will be a shame if i let this college thing go. But at this point i have to either choose between destroying myself, my body, and my mental health, to get to where i want to be IF i am even able to, or choose my health now over anything else, but still feel like a \"dumb fool\" thats not able to finish her education. Why is because many people who are less intelligent than me ARE able to get to higher ground just because of them being neurotypical. I don't want to be seen as someone who is below their level. Because i'm most definitely not. I think mostly like a neurotypical because i have been taught so. I've grown this much. But the autism is still there and it now only feels like a curse to me because it is limiting my abillities and it is limiting me from having a normal life. To be honest, i think autistics are the most beautiful people in the world. The kindest too. But for me, personally, i never feel like the perfect version of myself whenever i see another thing that makes me \"autistic\". I don't wish to use that label on myself anymore because i don't want to be considered an outsider. But this world simply isnt created for people like me and i always need to adjust which i can't always do, only to seem good enough by my own standards.\n",

God how i wish there'll be a time that'd be different. Why is because there should never be a time limit to learning. To education. Were all forced to follow a system. The same system not everyone can keep track of but imagine how many more people could achieve what they always wanted in life if it weren't this way? Then maybe we wouldn't be so underrestimated so much either. I love myself to the very core, and that is why i'm releiving myself from this misery people call \"fun neurotypical college education\" to save myself from countless mental health issues. But all that i'm letting go, to eventually hate myself once more because i'd only feel like a failure because i can't achieve what i had planned or do a simple task. And the little child in my head, hungry for revenge towards people who thought i would not get far in life, would die of hunger. Because i can't prove them wrong about me.\n",

      "I (15NB born female) have to go through a second ASD diagnostic because a psychward I've been to doubt my ASD diagnostic because my 'father' insisted I'm not autistic. I first got diagnosed when I was like 9 or 10. My 'father' always doubt that I'm autistic because 'he doesn't have the problems my mom has', the problems he meant are my symptoms. I broke contact in that psychward but they still wrote on the discharging letter that they doubt that I'm autistic. When I was little and got diagnosed I told everyone that I'm not autistic because my father told me to, he also told me that I'm not autistic because 'i can hold eye contact' and because 'i talk's and such kind of stuff. Fast forward till 2023, like I said I cut contact with him in 2021 and from time to time I accepted that I'm autistic and read a lot about autism to understand myself better so I can care for myself better. I got therapy specialized on autism (no ABA therapy or stuff like that) when I first got diagnosed but I didn't wanted to go there because of my 'father'. I told my mom I wanted that kind of therapy again because I need it. My mom tried to get me ASD therapy but because that Psychward doubt it ( they didn't took the diagnosis they just wrote on the paper when I got discharged that they don't think I am autistic) she couldn't get me enrolled in that. Now I have to go through a second diagnostic, everythings is okay it's annoying but still, I want and need that therapy so I'll just go with it BUT last week on a Wednesday I hat an appointment with the doctor who does my diagnostic. She told me that we do that diagnostic because it could be something else than Autism more than once in a tone that sounded like she is telling me that I'm not autistic. Im really panicing because if I get undiagnosed it's going to be so hard, no help specialized on ASD etc, being autistic and undiagnosed is, at least where I live, living hell and I'm scared that I won't get diagnosed again.\n",

I worry excessively, especially about the unknowns in my life, which means I have a great need for predictability. I get easily overwhelmed, although I'm not sure it has always been this way, it seems the knowledge of my diagnosis has made my tendency to overwhelm easily worse. I think in very black and white categories, and get really hung up on details, to the point that I often can't take a step back. My ability to socialize is limited, and I have never had as much interest in it as my peers. I have trouble with executive functioning: When I go to clean up my son's room, it's extraordinarily taxing when I don't know where a toy is supposed to go.\n",

But in general, I outgrew a lot of these tendencies, and as I got older, I found instinctive ways to deal with my issues pre-diagnosis. Like so many other late-diagnosis folks, I just thought I was a weird oddball, so in many ways the diagnosis has legitimized my being.\n",

Right now I can only work part-time, doing simple chores around the house feels overwhelming, and stuff like picking up my son from kindergarten is way harder on me than it was before I got my diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what is going on? I think on one level something positive has happened: I have become aware of my issues in daily life, and therefore they are more visible to me, and I have begun taking care of my own mental well-being. But on another level I feel like my focus on my limitations have become a chain and ball around my ankles. I have become so hyperfocused on autism, my psychosis episodes, stress, self-care, my worries, and so on - that they take up all my energy. Where I previously had excess energy and ressources to focus on stuff like running, or performing at work, now I only have enough energy to exist. I can only do the bare minimum, because for every thought I have about doing x for work, I have 10 thoughts related to my autism and how I should take care of myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I will call it: Self-care paralysis. It's as if all my efforts to take care of myself have taken on a life on its own, and is running on the processor in the back of my mind, having taken up all of the available ressources. So that leads me to question: Who am I apart from my diagnosis? Because I can't continue focusing exclusively on the autistic me, or I miss out completely on my own potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that I am strong. Resourceful. Capable. Loveable. Funny. Nice. I am a great learner and an attentive and great dad. I am honest and dependable, and a very loyal person. I am very intelligent, and really good at working with technology. I am well-read and hungry for knowledge, and I am a very passionate person. Some of these things may or may not relate to my autism, but they are me, and they are positives that are independent of the challenges I face due to my autism. I think it's time that I start thinking less about challenges, and more about opportunities. I'm also growing weary of project self-improvement, maybe there is nothing to improve at all about myself, maybe I'm perfect just the way I am?\n",

      "\n",
      "My dad is very likely to be autistic himself in some way, although he was never diagnosed. Both of my siblings are autistic just like me, and my dad knows of a fair few quirks about his side of the family that seem to suggest that autism in my siblings and I comes from his side. \n",
      "\n",
      "I feel frequent concern about the idea that I won't be able to feel the same things that any child I might have will have, both related to my own autism and the notable possibility that any biological child I might have will also be autistic in ways I have no way of predicting. \n",
      "\n",
      "Any life is full of pain and anxiety even for neurotypical people, and there is the significant risk of discrimination in the future as well. I know well what that can be like and how much it hurts, it feels like I don't want to bring someone else into this world that could experience all that even in a best case scenario. \n",
      "\n",
      "And it feels like I have no way of being sure that any mother will also be able to keep up the kind of relationship with me that would allow a child to see their parents both happy with each other. My parents separated and soon after divorced in 2018, and it was a time of extreme pain and heartbreak and mental illness for years after that I still have no resolution to. I feel a lot of anxiety that it could even remotely happen for a child. \n",
      "\n",
      "My parents, no matter how much you can love someone like my parents do and always do for me, did not make all the right choices, even when they tried very hard to do it right and acted in ways that could be reasonable given what they knew or could have known. Some of those errors still affect me today and it is very hard to not think about those errors or to not relive them. No child just comes with an instruction manual and is inevitably unique. I have some memories of good times, but I often feel and remember the bad times even more and come out at the worst moments. \n",

      "My autistic son is so difficult\n",
      "I have a 17-year-old son, J (pronounce it in your head as hota because weâre Latino) who is in high school. Heâs diagnosed with autism, dyslexia, tritanomaly (a very mild form of color blindness), depression, anxiety and long COVID.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was born at 30 weeks. He gets his name from an uncle who was premature too but passed during incubation, and sometimes I fucking wish my son had the same fate too. He had a rough childhood, with meltdowns and behavior issues seemingly every second. A 3-year-old bruising his parents! He went to mainstream preschool and used to be in fight after fight. He also couldnât speak and didnât sleep, his dad used to stay up all night trying to get him to sleep and didnât stop until J did, even if we put J to bed at 8 PM and he didnât fall asleep until 8 AM. \n",
      "\n",
      "At age 7, he got a diagnosis of low-functioning autism, and finally we got supports for him. Unfortunately, he didnât change much. We kept him home for most of his childhood. At some point, he started speaking but it was literally just echolalia from My Little Pony friendship is magic and Strawberry Shortcake (he watched a ton of TV as a kid). He eventually started properly speaking at 9 or 10 and even started uploading YouTube videos. Eventually, he started school at age 11 and as if by divine intervention (seriously, it had me wondering if that is real) he caught up to other kids extremely fast. Unfortunately, school was filled with meltdowns and behaviors as well as bullying, and he didnât have an aide back then. He left early or stayed home very often. But by then, his sibling rivalry with his sister started and she would do anything to humiliate him for her friends. He eventually got antipsychotics to calm him way down, and he never had any friends to keep him happy. The next few years were all the same, although I do remember him falling back into the same way heâd act at 7-8 during COVID. By then, he contracted COVID and ended up chronically ill with long COVID, making his attendance even worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, he switched to a new high school after an incident involving dick pics and he got an aide. Unfortunately, he also ruined his own health by avoiding the bathroom and he still does that. He doesnât even eat or drink most of the time. As of now, he keeps talking to me about some online drama that he gets himself into and ignores every single piece of advice he gets because he thinks everyone should worship him because theyâre interested in his way of life. And yet despite al this accommodation, he still wonât got to school. Most recently, heâs now suddenly best friends with his sister, and wonât leave her alone. The way he clings to her, and I know this is selfish, just annoys me because heâs like a toddler and his mommy yet when that was us, he was hitting and screaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "All he does all day is sleep in, watch some bullshit on TV like cartoons in Serbian (of all languages) or gaming or educational stuff, text people, act borderline incestuous to his sister, and cry over everything while thinking heâs so hard and manly. Heâs 17 but he honestly acts closer to a neurotypical 11 year old. I know they tested him and it said that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Dealing with this kid makes my life a living hell and yet his dad, aide and even sister (who used to constantly kick off at me over how spoiled her brother is) think Iâm just being entitled. Nobody ever thinks about how the parents are affected and my husband just romanticizes those years of caring for J because he thinks it makes him so woke or something. I am literally an alcoholic BECAUSE of the stress of caring for this boy, and all society and my family wants to do is point and laugh at me and call me entitled and a Karen. I hate my son for how my life has revolved around him for 18 years (taking pregnancy into account) and he doesnât appreciate it. I do everything for him, often without support, and he still complains. I think itâs true that I just let him become a spoiled brat instead of actually dealing with his disabilities. But I donât knowâ¦I could write a whole novel on this.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I am exhausted and lost. Anything that he finds âbetterâ is just at my disadvantage because heâs used to getting his own way 24/7. And weâre in Chile unlike most people here who are in the US, so we as a family are disadvantaged even more.\n",

      "A couple years ago, my older sister died suddenly. Two weeks after that, I lost my cat to old age as well. It was incredibly overwhelming, and at work, I was in training to be a team lead. My mental health was the worst it had ever been in my life, to the point I had to go to a crisis center for a 72-hour hold. I let my supervisor know I would be stepping back from my training, and why, I wasn't ashamed of my mental health struggles and I'm not now. I was officially diagnosed with autism and ADHD soon after my hospitalization, and I've been very open about that as well. I'm not ashamed of who I am, and most people have been supportive. \n",
      "\n",
      "You can probably guess by now that my autism is \"mild\", low support, what have you. With an official diagnosis, therapy/medication, and time passing, my mental health has gotten much better. I do have disability accomodations at work, mainly just needing extra breaks on occasion if I get too overwhelmed, and I've had these accommodations for the past year now. My supervisor at work is someone I don't really get along with. Every interaction I've ever had with him has left me feeling confused, and it seems like everything I say he takes as me trying to say something else, or have an ulterior motive, and I can't figure out why. \n",
      "\n",
      "I recently noticed they seemed to be training again for team leading. I felt I was ready to try it again, so yesterday, I went into his office and explained that I had noticed others being trained for it and wanted to make management aware that I am ready to try again, if the opportunity does arise again, if not now. I expected to be told, \"Thanks for letting us know, we will keep you in mind!\" And that be the end of it. But, that's not what happened. \n",
      "\n",
      "My supervisor immediately became standoffish and said he was under the impression I didn't ever want to do this job again. I pointed out that, no, I said at the time I could not do it, but that in the future, I am still open to being considered. He then pointed out that I became so overwhelmed and stressed by it last time, even joking that even HE had gotten worried about me. I felt confused as to why this was being brought up again and pointed out that my sister HAD just died suddenly, so yeah, I was very much stressed and overwhelmed at the time. He moved on to say, \"Well, we're not just going to remove *coworkers name* from learning the role, so.\" Which again, confused me because I wasn't asking for him to be removed from training...? I said I thought they were doing a great job, of course they shouldn't be removed and I wasn't even suggesting as such. The conversation ended shortly after with him finally saying he would discuss it with the other supervisor and they would keep me in mind, thanks, etc. I don't understand why the rest of that conversation even happened, just for him to end with that anyways. It left me upset and confused the rest of the day. \n",
      "\n",
      "This morning, I came to work, still upset from yesterday and dealing with grief on top of it, because it's the month my sister passed which is enough to deal with, and he triggered memories of the worst time of my life with his unnecessary comments the day before. I tried just working but shortly had to take one of my breaks. I let my team lead know where I would be, which is the only thing I have to do on my part without having to explain myself, and took a break in an empty office. I was in there for a short time, trying to regulate myself by doodling in my notebook, and had just started to feel calm enough to go back to work, when the supervisor came into the room. \n",
      "\n",
      "I immediately tensed up and he started asking me, what's going on? Is there something wrong with you? What can be done to help? At this point I was very close to becoming nonverbal but managed to say, repeatedly to every question, \"I just needed a break. I just need some time.\" He then made a point to say, \"Well, we do have designated break times, so.\" And I just. Froze up. After a few moments I managed to say, \"This is a disability accomodation.\" He only said \"Well, okay then.\" Hovered over me a few more moments, then left the room. And I just fell apart. It took another 20 minutes to calm myself down enough to go into the HR office, explain I was going home for the day, and say that I'd thank him not to come in during one of these breaks of mine and point out that we have designated breaks like an absolute asshole. HR just looked surprised at what I said and assured me I was fine to go home and take some time. But I don't know.\n",
      "\n",
      " I don't know what to fucking think right now. That felt like a huge privacy violation to me, and it shook me up really bad to have him come into that space and stand over me while I was sitting in a chair in the corner and visibly upset, under the guise of being \"concerned\" about me. He is well aware of my accomodation. He is aware I have taken such breaks before. My husband is so angry and thinks I'm being bullied by this guy, and a few friends were shocked to hear what happened and told me what he did was absolutely discrimination. But I'm so upset right now that I don't know what to think, or if it was really as bad as all that or if I'm just highly upset and not thinking clearly, but I know what happened and typing it out just strengthens my feeling that I'm being messed with, for some reason that I cannot fathom.
